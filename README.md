# SENTIMENTBOT

THIS IS A SIMPLE BOT MADE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES WHILE WAITING FOR COLLEAGUES AT AN AIRPORT

HERE IS HOW YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER
1. the current audio-only inputs .waw file which may not always be convenient and the transcribe function is not so good. you can try to make the transcribe better by using better code or models and or also try including multiple inputs and audio formats
2. the output columns are very basic and simple. you can try to add more output columns to give more realistic feedback to better help deal with customers in real life.
3. you can try to bring in data from external souces in the form of CSV. i.e call data records and upload directly into the rows and get cumulative report
4. try to make it more aesthetic and appealing by adding images etc. This is a POC you can maybe write down how you may scale this
5. try different llama models and better prompting to get better more precise output
